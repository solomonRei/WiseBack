# Project README

## What is Wise:
Wise stands out as a must-have tool for content creators and video aficionados, delivering rapid video summaries that save you from watching entire videos, alongside insightful tag analytics, viewership trends, and personalized content recommendations via ChatGPT. Built on a solid foundation of Spring Java, Flask Python, React JS, and SQL database, it provides a seamless, efficient, and user-friendly experience, ensuring your YouTube content is optimized for maximum engagement and performance.

This project contains three Docker Compose files that set up the necessary services for the application. The services include a PostgreSQL database, RabbitMQ, a backend application, and a frontend application.
